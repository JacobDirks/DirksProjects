**This tab is currently pending help from a team member of the project who has the code.

## Overview

<!-- Insert information about the goals of the project and what the project is. -->
Take a need from the agricultural community, in specific regarding the growth or maintenance of crops, and for our group we chose an automatic boom leveling device. Since this is a school project it is important to note that I received permission to use this assignment here. One other piece of information that is important, this project was meant strictly to create a functional prototype and complete an elevator pitch.

## Contribution

<!-- Talk about what parts I did for the project -->
Within the team's composition I was in charge of working directly with the project head to ensure we stayed on top of deadlines and I was in charge of the code base. This involved leading the development of the code and researching how various sensors sent signals back to the controller and how to use those signals.

## Results

<!-- Did we meet project reqs, did we achieve initially goals? -->
We developed a working prototype that had room for improvement using another motor and another sensor.

Lessons learned:
Arduino: interactions with an IR sensor, develop with iterative hardware requirements, and record benchmark steps.
